  <h1>Chocolates are my favorite</h1>
  <p>There is nothing any better than a good piece of chocolate. Its rich, its creamy, its smooth, and it makes us feel so-o-o-o good for a few moments of course, that is; until the guilt of the calories kick in. Chocolate happens to be one of my favorite sweets. The wonderful creamy milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, white chocolate, or even my personal favorite a silky dark chocolate, the choices are hard. I sat down this weekend to really think about, and compare the differences. I compared my two favorite types of chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. Milk chocolate is usually paired with nuggets, nuts, creams or caramels, but the dark chocolate is best with a wine such as a Muscat Canelli. Either makes for a good treat for your tastebuds.</p>

  <p>Now is the time to get over the guilt of eating chocolate because of the calories. Science has found that there are some good reasons to eat and enjoy good pieces of chocolate. They have findings to prove that it acts as an antioxidant because of the flavonoids, lowering blood pressure, in turn benefiting the heart (WebMD).  Let me give you a few reasons beyond that. Milk chocolate and dark chocolate taste good. They both stimulate endorphins, the pleasure feelings. They both have a type of serotonin, a form of anti-depressant. Both milk chocolate and dark chocolate are stimulants; that is because of the theobromine found in caffeine. The theobromine in chocolate is released at a slower rate than caffeine, so the effects are longer and slower, without the rush or jittery effects that coffee can have. Even parts of the fats in chocolate are converted into mono-unsaturated fats, thanks to the liver. Now these finding have proven that the milk chocolate is not as powerful with all these benefits as the dark chocolate is, but they are still there. Also, the milk chocolates are of course higher in the calories, because of the fats from the sugar, and cream that are used to produce milk chocolate</p>
